<p>This is a simple site that didn’t use the CoolBrew CMS much except to include header and footer files and run the Contact Us form. It was a triumph in the sense that I was able to take a fairly disorganized and inconsistent site and build a clean, consistent one. It required focused attention to detail and an open dialog with the client to ensure that I didn’t make too many assumptions about how their business works. The work was completed in a couple of days.</p>
