<p>The goal with this new framework was to create the next generation of hcgPublic. I had continued to look, but I was unable to find an existing CMS that would do what I needed with multiple sites, so I determined that I needed to build my own. I chose CodeIgniter because it was lightweight and well structured.</p>

<p>So far, I have written thirteen modules for CoolBrew including products, store locator, Active Directory search, site administration, SEO tools, recipes, contests, job listings, lists, mailform, and pages. The system is running about eight sites at the moment.</p>

<p>Built with: LAMP, CodeIgniter, elements from hcgPublic</p>

<p>Responsible for Program Design, PHP Programming, Database Design, Default Template Design</p>
