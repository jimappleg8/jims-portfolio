## Jim Applegate's Portfolio

Congratulations! You've found Jim Applegate's portfolio website. This site is based on the [Phantom Jekyll Theme](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/phantom) by Jami Gibbs. I started with her theme and tweaked it quite a bit (as we developers tend to do) for my own needs.

The site is also hosted on Github pages at [https://jimappleg8.com/](https://jimappleg8.com/).

The site was set up to use Webpack and React components using an [excelent guide](https://medium.com/@allizadrozny/using-webpack-and-react-with-jekyll-cfe137f8a2cc) by Alli Zadrozny.
